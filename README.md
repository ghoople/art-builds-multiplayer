# Art Builds Multiplayer

This A-Frame based VR experience allows you to easily experience  3D models in a simulated environment with your collaborators. 

This is based on a NAF Easty RTC Adapter Network adapter fork: https://github.com/open-easyrtc/naf-easyrtc-adapter



Edit examples/index.html to import your own models.  

Host your models on Github to deploy them correctly 

"master" branch is deprecated - not sure if it can be deleted. 

"browser-only" branch is configured to work well with mobile or computer based browsers (Deployed at Heroku at https://art-builds.herokuapp.com/) 

"oculus-vr" branch is configured to work with the Oculus Rift 2 headset and controllers only. 

I tried to combining these two, but there are issues with the camera rig needed for teleportation and WASD controllers for the keyboard.
